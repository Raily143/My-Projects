Paperwork, licenses, legal forms, and strategies written in jargon no one really understood… it was enough to scare away even the most passionate entrepreneurs.","So in 2010, we decided to change that. What started as one person with a laptop, a lot of coffee, and a mission to make business easier has grown into a team of experienced consultants helping entrepreneurs across the world.","We believe business should be exciting, not overwhelming. Our goal has always been to take the scary parts — the paperwork, the financial planning, the strategy-building — and make them simple, clear, and even fun. Over the years, we’ve guided hundreds of entrepreneurs through the steps of turning their ideas into thriving companies.","Company Timeline","2010","The beginning","Every great story starts with an idea. Ours was simple: help people start businesses without feeling lost in jargon and endless paperwork. Armed with one desk, one laptop, and a big pot of coffee, we began turning that idea into reality.","2012","First wins","We landed our very first clients — brave entrepreneurs who trusted us when we were just starting out. We celebrated every launch like it was our own birthday party (cake included). Those early wins gave us the confidence to keep going.","2015","Growing team, bigger dreams","What started as a one-person dream grew into a team of passionate problem-solvers. Each new teammate brought fresh energy, new skills, and their own ideas about how to make business support even better. Suddenly, brainstorming sessions felt like mini think-tanks.","2018","Going global","Our calls and emails began coming from all over the world. Entrepreneurs from new markets wanted our help — and we couldn’t have been more excited. Supporting clients across different cultures gave us a bigger vision: to make starting a business easier everywhere.","2020","Remote but unstoppable","When the world slowed down, we sped up. We adapted to remote work overnight, offering even more online support so no entrepreneur felt left behind. It was a tough time, but also the year we proved how resilient small businesses (and we) could be.","2023","200+ businesses launched","From cozy cafés to global tech startups, we had officially helped more than 200 businesses launch. Every milestone wasn’t just a number — it was a story of someone’s dream coming alive. And yes, we might’ve shed a tear or two of pride.","Today","Still evolving","We’re not done yet. Business challenges keep changing, and so do we. From smarter digital tools to bigger support systems, we continue to make entrepreneurship simpler, friendlier, and way less overwhelming. Our mission stays the same: turning bold ideas into thriving businesses.","\"When I started this company, I knew one thing for sure — business shouldn’t feel scary.
